# Oko Agro — Project Description

## What Is Oko Agro?

**Oko Agro** (also written as **Òkó Agro**) is an online agricultural marketplace that connects **farmers** directly with **processors** — the businesses that buy crops to turn them into food, flour, starch, or other products. Think of it as a trusted bridge between the farm and the factory, designed specifically for African agriculture.

The name reflects its purpose: bringing together the agricultural community through technology and quality assurance, with a focus on trust, fairness, and growth.

## The Problem We Address

Across Africa, farmers often struggle to:

- **Reach the right buyers** — Many rely on middlemen who take a large share of the profit.
- **Get fair prices** — Lack of direct access to processors keeps prices low.
- **Prove quality** — Processors hesitate to buy without reliable quality information.
- **Get paid quickly** — Delayed or opaque payments create cash flow problems.

On the other side, processors face challenges such as:

- **Finding reliable suppliers** — Difficulty sourcing consistent, high-quality raw materials.
- **Trusting what they buy** — Uncertainty about product quality before delivery.
- **Efficient sourcing** — Time spent searching and vetting suppliers instead of focusing on production.

Oko Agro addresses these issues by connecting both sides on one platform, with built-in quality checks and transparent processes.

## Our Vision

- **Ensure quality for processors** — Through professional inspection and certification.
